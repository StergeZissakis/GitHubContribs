# Overview
This directory contains Postman exports of an environment and a collection of requests.
<br>
Postman has been used since day 1 to explore the different GitHub API endpoints as well as call this API's endpoints to
debug them.
<br>
Please note that I have had problems in the past, importing such exports into Postman. The export version used was v2.1.
<br>
Good luck!
